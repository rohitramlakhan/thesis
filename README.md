# Thesis

This repository contains the data of the case studies that were implemented and described in the thesis <br>
'Modelling the legal spaces of 3D underground objects in a 3D Land Administration System'.

## Case studies

There are two cases: <br> 
- case 1. Sewage pipes in Almere (case_almere) <br>
- case 2. Heinenoordtunnel (case_heinenoord) <br> 

In both folders of the cases are all the filed to recreate the steps written in Chapter 5. Case studies of the thesis.

Exception is the original model of the Heinenoordtunnel and the 3D Tiles of the simplified Heinenoordtunnel. <br>
These files were too large (also after zipping) to upload to Github. <br>
The zipped file from the simplified IFC model of the Heinenoordtunnel is there. <br>
It should therefore be possible to create the 3D Tiles of the simplified Heinenoordtunnel. <br>

## Visualising the case studies


### Method 1

Links to directly visualising the cases in Cesium Sandcastle can be found in the following folders and documents: <br>

For case 1: case_almere/Cesium JS/case_almere.txt <br> 
For case 2: case_heinenoord/Cesium JS/case_heinenoord.txt <br>
Copy and paste the link of the case that you want to visualise to the internet browser. <br>

### Method 2

If the link does not work, an alternative method to visualising the case studies in Cesium Sandcastle is: <br>

Download the files cs1_cesium_javascript.js and cs1_cesium_css.css from the folder case_almere/Cesium JS for the case in Almere and / or <br>
download the files cs2_cesium_javascript.js and cs2_cesium_css.css from the folder case_heinenoord/Cesium JS for the case in Heinenoord. <br>
Open the files with Notepad or Notepad++. <br>
Go to https://sandcastle.cesium.com/. <br>
Copy the content of the Javascript file to the tab 'JavaScript code' of Sandcastle (delete what is written there first). <br>
Copy the content of the CSS file to the tab 'HTML body & CSS' of Sandcastle (delete what is written there first). <br>
Then press the button 'Run (F8)'. <br>
