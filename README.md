# Thesis

This repository contains the data of the case studies that were implemented and described in the thesis 
'Modelling the legal spaces of 3D underground objects in a 3D Land Administration System'.

There are two cases: case 1: Sewage pipes in Almere and case 2: Heinenoordtunnel

In both folders of the cases are all the filed to recreate the steps written in Chapter 5. Case studies of the thesis.

Exception is the original model of the Heinenoordtunnel and the 3D Tiles of the simplified Heinenoordtunnel. 
These files were too large (also after zipping) to upload to Github.
The zipped file from the simplified IFC model of the Heinenoordtunnel is there.
It should therefore be possible to create the 3D Tiles of the simplified Heinenoordtunnel
